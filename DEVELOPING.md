# Developing the extension

## Prerequisites
Have a working version of Yarn.

## Get started
1. Fork or clone this repository
1. Run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
1. Run `yarn run start`

This will start a Firefox instance that will reload automatically on each change. The profile of
this instance is persisted at `.profiles/firefox`.
